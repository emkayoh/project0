# Project 0

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

a project that describes my old van.
The first page is a text introduction, while pages 1,2 and three highlight certain areas of the van and its history. Page 1 has a table showing the colour date of first registration and date on MOT expiry. Page 2 is a list of milages when the van had an MOT test. Page three has two photos showing repairs being made to the rear brakes and a picture of the van In Switzerland travelling over the Gotthard pass.
